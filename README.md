Create reusable feature or check lists that you can add to any post or page. Great for houses, hotels, cars, products,
and anytime you want to display a set of items that each have a subset of a group of features.

Simply:

1. Create a list that consists of items organised into various groups.
1. In your post, insert the [efl_feature_list] shortcode where you want the list.
1. Select the feature list you want from the metabox below the post editor.
1. Set the value for each feature. This lets you create one list and reuse it across
multiple posts, changing only the text or checkbox for each feature.

Other features are planned for the future, so let me know of any requests via the Support forum. I provide paid support
and custom development via my company as well. Email me at admin@qedev.com with any critical or larger requests.

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

#### How do I style the feature list? ####

The feature lists are simple &lt;table&gt; and &lt;input&gt; elements so your theme's CSS will affect the styling. I've included
classes for the elements that you can create selectors for as well. If you need any custom styling and you don't want
to worry about this, contact me at admin@qedev.com and we can discuss any jobs you need done.

#### How do I remove a feature group? ####

On the Edit Feature List page, simply remove all the features from the feature group you wish to delete.
