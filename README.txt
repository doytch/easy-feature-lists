Create reusable feature or check lists that you can add to any post or page.

== Description ==

Create reusable feature or check lists that you can add to any post or page. Great for houses, hotels, cars, products,
and anytime you want to display a set of items that each have a subset of a group of features. 

Simply:

1. Create a list that consists of items organised into various groups.
1. In your post, insert the [efl_feature_list] shortcode where you want the list.
1. Select the feature list you want from the metabox below the post editor.
1. Check the items that you want checked in the feature list. This lets you create one list and have reuse it across
multiple posts, only changing what is checked.

Other features are planned for the future, so let me know of any requests via the Support forum. I provide paid support
and custom development via my company as well. Email me at admin@qedev.com with any critical or larger requests.

== Installation ==

You don't really need to do anything special to install this plugin. Just:

1. Download using the button above, unzip and place the folder in your wp-content/plugins/ folder. Alternately,

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I style the feature list? =

The feature lists are simple &lt;table&gt; and &lt;input&gt; elements so your theme's CSS will affect the styling. I've included
classes for the elements that you can create selectors for as well. If you need any custom styling and you don't want
to worry about this, contact me at admin@qedev.com and we can discuss any jobs you need done.

== Screenshots ==

1. Feature lists are created using simple markup. In this example, three feature groups are being created with various
features in each group.
2. Lists are selected and customised using the metabox below the editor, and inserted into posts and pages using a shortcode.
3. The feature list displayed under the WordPress Twenty Twelve theme. Styling is controlled via your theme.
